# Zomato-Data-Analysis
Analyzed the Data performing ETL , DATA CLEANING ,EDA and VISUALIZATIONS in jupyter notebook implementing python libraries .
Hi All 👋🏻! <br>

Excited to Share my Zomato Data Analysis Using Python 🚀<br>



•Libraries Used:🎯<br>

1.pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, including reading and cleaning the dataset.<br>

2.numpy: For numerical operations, such as handling missing values and data type conversions.<br>

3.matplotlib and seaborn: For creating visualizations and plots to understand trends in the data.<br>

•Operations Involved:🎯<br>

1.Data Loading: Imported the dataset using pandas with pd.read_csv() and examined the initial structure of the data.<br>

•Data Cleaning:🎯<br>

1.Removed unnecessary columns like 'url', 'address', 'phone', and 'reviews_list'.<br>

2.Dropped duplicates and handled missing values in critical columns like 'rate', replacing them with the column's mean.<br>

3.Cleaned specific columns such as converting 'rate' values from strings to floats and handling inconsistent formats in the 'Cost2plates' column.<br>

•Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):🎯<br>

1.Checked the shape and column data types of the DataFrame.<br>

2.Identified unique values in key columns to understand the distribution of data, such as restaurant types and locations.<br>

•Visualizations:🎯<br>

1.Utilized matplotlib and seaborn to create graphs and plots that showcase trends, distributions, and relationships within the data.<br>
